Follow with 2-3 sentences explaining why, referencing recent SPY, QQQ, and IWM price action and any relevant macro context.\n\n2. Sector Leaderboard\nRank all 11 S&P 500 sectors from strongest to weakest based on 1-week performance. Use the following ETFs as proxies: XLK, XLY, XLC, XLV, XLF, XLI, XLE, XLB, XLRE, XLU, XLP. For each sector show: Rank, Sector name, ETF ticker, 1-week % change, and a one-line characterization (Leading / Neutral / Lagging).\n\n3. Growth Stock Opportunities This Week\nBased on the sector leaderboard above, identify the 2-3 sectors currently showing the strongest conditions for growth stock setups — regardless of which sectors they are. For each: explain why it is attracting institutional interest, what type of growth stocks within that sector are worth watching, and what would confirm or invalidate the opportunity heading into the week.\n\n4. Weekly Bias Statement\nIn 2-3 sentences, summarize what this environment means for a growth stock trader heading into the week. Should they be aggressive, selective, or defensive? What is the single most important thing to watch?",
